This is a completely unfinished and experimental attempt to replicate the map used in Slay the Spire, a roguelike cardgame.
The code is atrocious, and at the moment does not do anything even vaguely close to what I am trying to achieve.

It is intended to be used in Unity. The rendering of the graph uses Gizmos.
